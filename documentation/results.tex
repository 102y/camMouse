Under constant lighting conditions and steady head movements, the system performs fairly well; more than 10 tracking features are successfully tracked for 500 frames. With regular tracking and display of the tracking features, the systems achieves a frame rate of $9.08$ fps. Without the display of the tracking features, the system achieves a frame rate of $10.25$ fps. With no feedback at all, the system achieves a frame rate of $18.88$ fps.

To further evaluate the performance of the tracking, we compared the head position determined by the system to the head position manually marked by the user. Over a set of $500$ frames, I compared the user's true head position and that determined by the system for every $100th$ frame. On an average, the Euclidean distance between the true head-position and the mean head-position was $401$ pixels which is $1.06\%$ of the face template's diagonal length.

A demonstration of the system's current implementation is available on YouTube~\cite{demo}.
