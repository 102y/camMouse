\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

Conventionally, the mouse pointer of a computer is controlled by a peripheral device such as a mouse or a touch-pad. The goal of this project is to develop a robust computer vision system that allows its users to control a computer's mouse pointer using head movements. Such a system would undoubtedly useful for impaired users, such as those with Cerebral Palsy or those with spinal cord injuries, since they are not able to effectively use a regular mouse/touch-pad. Currently, commercial implementations of vision-based trackers to control a mouse pointer exist. Some require special accessories or hardware, such as hats or high quality cameras; some require an initial input from the user on every system-start to choose the face-patch to track~\cite{bucammouse} while some neither require any input from the user nor do they require any special hardware. In the system developed for this project, user-input is required only once and the whole head, as apposed to a fixed face-patch, is used to control the mouse pointer (similar to the iTracker by EyeTwig~\cite{eyetwig}).
